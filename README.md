# RESTful-API-with-Python-and-Django-framework
 This is a fully functional production RESTful API for bicyle parking invoices with endpoints for creating, updating, deleting and viewing invoices. This API provides functionality for most Front-End frameworks and for different types of applications and databases. It was built for mainly bike-sharing companies and government stakeholders as part of the project: "<i>Improving Urban Cycling with Social Sensing in Tallinn , Estonia</i>". It complies to the features of a RESTful API and has been built for high scalability, visibility, reliability and easy interaction.
 
 # Source Files
 The API was built in a virtual environment for easy deployment.Thus, in the virtual environment directory are the most important files which can be found in the invoicesapp subfolder. They are the models.py, serializers.py, and views.py files. The subfolders and files are well structured to provide a centralized data system and functionality for the Front-End frameworks that will utilize the API.
 
 # Testing
 Testing was carried out by the RequestFactory helper class that extend Django's existing test framework, and this highly supports  making API requests.There are further tests to be carried out since this RESTful web service leaves room for more improvements.
